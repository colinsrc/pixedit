PixEdit is a program I developed while taking a college level programming course in High School.

Functions:
 - Opening and viewing images (JPEGs, PNGs, Bitmaps, etc.)
 - Editing opened images
 - Saving edited images
 - Printing edited works
 
 This project was something I did fairly early on from when I first learned to program, so the source may not be the prettiest, and I can gurrantee there are some things I could do differently to increase efficiency, but this project is for educational purposes only and I do not plan on developing it further.
 
 I hope you enjoy PixEdit.
 
 Thanks,
 Colin
